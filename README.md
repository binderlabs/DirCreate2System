# DirCreate2System
Weaponizing to get NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for Privileged Directory Creation Bugs with Windows Error Reporting

### Short Description:
I've discovered **comctl32.dll** (which is missing in system dir which doesn't really exist) has been loaded by wermgr.exe via windows error reporting by running schtasks. It means if we can create a folder name as **C:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe.local** with Full permission ACL, we can hijack the **comctl32.dll** in that folders. Then, I created this poc as a Directory creation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM shell method.

### **POC video** 
[POC.wmv](https://github.com/binderlabs/DirCreate2System/blob/main/poc.wmv) (with backblaze's directory creation bug)
#### Remark: I've already reported to backblaze and they replied me that it's know issues. So, I made a video poc for educational purpose of this dircreate2system poc.

### For testing purposes: 
(if you have a directory creation bug via service vulnerabilities, you don't need administrator access)
1. **As an administrator**, create directory `wermgr.exe.local` in `C:\Windows\System32\`
2. And then, give it access control `cacls C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe.local /e /g everyone:f`
3. Place `spawn.dll` file and `dircreate2system.exe` in a same directory.
4. Then, run `dircreate2system.exe`.
5. Enjoy a shell as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
